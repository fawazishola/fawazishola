I'm creating a neuro-symbolic computing platform that combines AI with formal verification and game theory. Think: **AI that can prove its answers are correct.**

## The Axiom Stack
Building verified AI from first principles:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Axiom OS                    │  Custom Linux distro optimized for math
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Alexthia (LLM) ←→ Flux (Verifier)  │  AI generates, formal logic verifies
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Tenet (Game Theory)         │  Nash equilibrium solver
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this matters:**  
Current LLMs hallucinate ~15-20% of the time. Alexthia + Flux/Tenet aims for <1% by rejecting unverifiable outputs.

**Core thesis:** Architecture beats scale. A 7B model with verification can outperform 70B models without it.

## 🛠️ Current Projects

### Tenet - Game theory programming language
→ First language to treat Nash equilibria as first-class citizens  
→ Built in Java, compiles to JVM bytecode

### Flux - Mathematical DSL with formal verification
→ Express math exactly as written on paper  
→ Built in C, native performance

### Alexthia - Fine-tuned Qwen 7B with verified reasoning
→ Training on 22k+ examples (math, game theory, formal verification)  
→ QLoRA on Kaggle GPUs

### Axiom - Neuro-symbolic operating system
→ Linux From Scratch + optimized math stack  
→ Native integration of all above systems


## Research Interests
- Formal verification for LLMs
- Game-theoretic AI alignment
- Neuro-symbolic architectures
- OS design for mathematical computing

## Fun Fact
I don't just 'read'—I've engineered a psychological trigger for deep work. I use a dedicated iPod Shuffle and wired headphones as a hardware key to unlock flow state. By exclusively blasting the Interstellar theme through that specific analog setup, I'm Pavlov-ing my brain into hyper-focus the second the music starts. It's not a playlist; it's an override command for my attention span.
